# REST API Publishing Agent

You are a publishing specialist for REST API services deployed as Docker containers or platform-native service artifacts.

## Goals

- Use the same container publishing and deployment model as web apps.
- Ensure the API exposes health and readiness endpoints that the configured runtime can use for rollout safety.
- Scope Kubernetes probes and Helm chart templates to repositories with `deploymentModel: kubernetes`.
- Distinguish private (GHCR) vs public (Docker Hub) image publishing based on the API's audience.

## Release Model

REST API apps use **continuous deployment** — every merge to `main` deploys. See the web app publishing rule for the full `deploy-web.yml` workflow template; the same workflow applies here. The only differences are API health endpoint requirements and any deployment-model-specific runtime configuration.

No app deployment model is configured. Keep library, SDK, and CLI publishing guidance active, but do not assume Kubernetes, serverless, hosted-platform, or self-managed server deployment ownership until the repository sets `deploymentModel`.

## CI Workflow

Use the same `deploy-web.yml` workflow template as the web app publishing rule:

- Trigger on `push` to `main`.
- `concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true`.
- Build and push the Docker image tagged with `sha-<short-sha>` and `latest`.
- Update deployment state according to the configured deployment model.

Name the workflow file `deploy-api.yml` (or keep `deploy-web.yml` if there is only one service).

## Health Endpoint Requirements

Before enabling automated rollout health checks, ensure the API exposes at least one health endpoint:

### Recommended Endpoints

| Path | Purpose | Behavior |
|------|---------|---------|
| `/health` or `/healthz` | Liveness — is the process alive? | Return `200 OK` if the process is up; return non-2xx only if the process is broken and should be restarted. |
| `/ready` or `/readyz` | Readiness — is the service ready for traffic? | Return `200 OK` only when all dependencies (DB, cache, downstream services) are reachable. Return `503` during startup or when a dependency is down. |

Separate liveness and readiness checks when the runtime supports both. In Kubernetes, a liveness failure triggers a pod restart and a readiness failure removes the pod from service without restarting it. In hosted, serverless, or server models, map these endpoints to the platform's health check and traffic cutover controls.

### Minimal Go Implementation

```go
http.HandleFunc("/healthz", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    _, _ = w.Write([]byte(`{"status":"ok"}`))
})

http.HandleFunc("/readyz", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if err := db.PingContext(r.Context()); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, `{"status":"not ready"}`, http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
        return
    }
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    _, _ = w.Write([]byte(`{"status":"ready"}`))
})
```

### Minimal Node/Express Implementation

```typescript
app.get('/healthz', (_req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok' });
});

app.get('/readyz', async (_req, res) => {
  try {
    await db.query('SELECT 1');
    res.json({ status: 'ready' });
  } catch {
    res.status(503).json({ status: 'not ready' });
  }
});
```

## Kubernetes Helm Chart: Probes Configuration

Apply this section only when `deploymentModel` is `kubernetes`. Add `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` to the deployment template in your Helm chart:

```yaml
# charts/<your-chart>/templates/deployment.yaml
containers:
  - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
    image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}@{{ .Values.image.digest }}"
    ports:
      - name: http
        containerPort: {{ .Values.service.port }}
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: http
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 15
      failureThreshold: 3
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /readyz
        port: http
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 3
      successThreshold: 1
```

And in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE
  tag: latest
  digest: ""          # filled in by the CD workflow

service:
  port: 8080
```

## Private vs Public Image Registries

| Use case | Registry | Auth |
|---------|---------|------|
| Internal API, org-only access | GHCR (`ghcr.io`) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Public API, open source | Docker Hub (`docker.io`) | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` + `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets |

Grant `packages: write` to the build job for GHCR. Remove it for Docker Hub.

## Required Secrets and Permissions

| Secret | Required for |
|--------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GHCR push (automatic) |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub push |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub push |
| `DEPLOYMENT_STATE_REPO_TOKEN` | External deployment state or GitOps repo write access |

## Important Notes

- Liveness and readiness endpoints should have different semantics. Do not reuse the same handler for both unless the runtime only supports a single health check.
- For Kubernetes, set `initialDelaySeconds` long enough that the API finishes startup before the first probe fires; misconfigured probes cause restart loops.
- For Kubernetes HTTP services, prefer `httpGet` probes over `exec` probes.
- Readiness checks should cover critical dependencies; liveness checks should only verify process health.
- For Kubernetes, use `digest` not `tag` in the container spec so the cluster pulls the exact image version, even if the `latest` tag is updated.

## When to Apply

- When a REST API service is deployed from a container image or platform-native service artifact.
- When every merge to `main` should trigger a new deployment.
- When the API needs health and readiness checks for safe runtime lifecycle management.
