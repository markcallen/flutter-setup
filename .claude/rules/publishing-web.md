# Publishing Rules

These rules help design and maintain release workflows for libraries, SDKs, and apps.

# Web App Publishing Agent

You are a publishing specialist for web applications deployed as Docker containers or platform-native app artifacts.

## Goals

- Build and publish a Docker image to GHCR or Docker Hub on every merge to `main`.
- Tag images with the git SHA and `latest`; capture the digest for immutable deploys.
- Update deployment state according to the configured deployment model after the image is pushed.
- Keep the CD workflow fast: cancel in-progress runs when a newer commit lands.

## Release Model

Web apps use **continuous deployment** — every merge to `main` deploys. There is no manual version bump or `workflow_dispatch` trigger. If a named semver release is also needed (e.g. for a public API), create a separate `release.yml` workflow that responds to `v*` tags.

No app deployment model is configured. Keep library, SDK, and CLI publishing guidance active, but do not assume Kubernetes, serverless, hosted-platform, or self-managed server deployment ownership until the repository sets `deploymentModel`.

## Workflow Trigger and Concurrency

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

`cancel-in-progress: true` ensures the newest commit's deploy always wins.

## CI Workflow Template (`deploy-web.yml`)

```yaml
name: Deploy Web

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

          git commit -m "chore: update <your-app> image to sha-$(echo '${{ github.sha }}' | head -c 7)"
          git push
```

## Container Registry Targets

Choose one registry per deployment. Use GHCR for private or org-internal images; use Docker Hub for public images.

### GHCR (`ghcr.io`)

- Authenticate with `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no extra secret needed for same-repo images).
- Grant `packages: write` permission to the job.
- Image URL: `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>` or `ghcr.io/<owner>/<image-name>`.

### Docker Hub (`docker.io`)

- Add `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (access token, not password) as repository secrets.
- Remove the `packages: write` permission from the job.
- Image URL: `docker.io/<namespace>/<image>`.

## Deployment State Update Rules

- Prefer digest pinning (`image.digest`) over tag pinning for production deploys.
- Keep the `image.tag` field for human readability alongside the digest.
- Do not overwrite unrelated environment values in the automation step.
- If a deployment state repo is private, use a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App credential (`DEPLOYMENT_STATE_REPO_TOKEN`) scoped to Contents: Read and write on that repo only.
- For Kubernetes, bump the chart `version` field when chart templates in `charts/<app>/` change, not on every image update.

## Required Secrets and Permissions

| Secret | Required for |
|--------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GHCR push (automatic) |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub push |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub push |
| `DEPLOYMENT_STATE_REPO_TOKEN` | External deployment state or GitOps repo write access |

## README Badge

Add a badge for the deploy workflow:

```markdown
[![Deploy](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/deploy-web.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/deploy-web.yml)
```

## Important Notes

- Do not push mutable `latest` tags as the only tag; always include the SHA tag so deploys are traceable.
- Use `docker/setup-buildx-action` and `cache-from: type=gha` to speed up repeated builds.
- The deployment state update job should be omitted when the deployment model does not use an external state repository.
- When present, the deployment state update job should be a no-op (early exit) when there are no changes, to avoid empty commits.
- For Kubernetes, keep the Helm chart in `charts/<app>/` in the application repo and keep ArgoCD environment configuration in the separate GitOps repo.
- If multiple environments exist (staging, production), make the target environment explicit in workflow inputs or use separate workflows.

## When to Apply

- When a web application is deployed from a container image or platform-native app artifact.
- When every merge to `main` should trigger a new deployment.
- When the team wants immutable image references or artifact identifiers in deployment state.
